DISMATH CLASS March 9

Continuation of Algorithms
-Algorithm: Binary Search

Input: {a1,...,an}
Output: Location
    If loc = {a1,...,an}, FOUND
    Else, -1
    
*Binary search is faster and more efficient than Linear search because the former deduces the set of numbers to
obtain smaller subsets for more efficient search, whereas linear compares the input value with each element in
the set one at a time.
